# Berlin Museum Map

This is part of Udacity's Front End Web Development Nanodegree.
It is a map of Berlin, showing you museum locations. Clicking on a marker/museum in the sidebar will show you an info window with an image of the museum and their Foursquare rating.

To get up and running, follow these steps:
